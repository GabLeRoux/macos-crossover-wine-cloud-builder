# MacOS CrossOver FOSS built from the Cloud

[![.github/workflows/build.yml](https://github.com/GabLeRoux/macos-crossover-cloud-build/workflows/.github/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/GabLeRoux/macos-crossover-cloud-build/actions) <-- help me fix that! [#6](https://github.com/GabLeRoux/macos-crossover-cloud-build/issues/6)

Let's build [FOSS CrossOver][foss-crossover] for macOS in the cloud! I found [some gists][crossover-gist] and I asked myself why don't we use the cloud and the free open source builders to build this? Here it is.

## How this works?

1. See [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
2. See [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](./.github/workflows/build.yml)
3. See [`build.sh`](./build.sh)

## Is it working?

Not for me, see [#6](https://github.com/GabLeRoux/macos-crossover-cloud-build/issues/6)

## Inspiration

I learned about [Free and Open Source Software Code for CrossOver][foss-crossover] and found [this gist][crossover-gist].

## Where to download builds?

See [#2](https://github.com/GabLeRoux/macos-crossover-cloud-build/issues/2)

## Can I run [`build.sh`](./build.sh) locally?

It will only work if you're on macOS, but yes. Clone the project, read the script first, then feel free to do it 👍. This is an [MIT](LICENSE.md) repo. If you break something on your system doing so, it's your fault 😉

## Can I contribute?

Definitely. Feel free to send PRs 🚀
